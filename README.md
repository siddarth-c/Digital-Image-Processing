# Beer Blurrer

The Indian cinema censor board demands to blur alcohol bottles in movies but it is a tedious job to do it manually. Pertaining to this issue we have devised a computer vision model which automatically detects the presence of alcohol bottles in the frame/image. The region of interest is thus obtained, which undergoes a process of image segmentation to accurately obtain the pixels that are contributing to the bottle. Those are the pixels that will be prone to gaussian blur.
